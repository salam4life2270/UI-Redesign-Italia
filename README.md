# UI-Redesign-Italia
I tried to make the design to look appealing for the users. I used color contrast checker to improve readability buythe users

I used some witespace in my design to enhance breathability.
Alignment: I used center for the headings and left align for the texts.

Contrast in elements and color: I tried to balance the background and forground for good users interface, where I have text over image, I make the text white.

Color pallette: I have chosen a cool gray background together with a red background for the gallery part which makes the photos in the gallery more appealing.

Scale/Visual hierarchy: The headers are bigger than the paragraph text to get attention of users.

Use of typography: 
Rule of odds: On the first page, I interchange the image and the texts to make it more appealling.
